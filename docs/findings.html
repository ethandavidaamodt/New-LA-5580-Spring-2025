    <h2>What I Found</h2>
    <p>
      This project looked at how many people in ten Iowa counties live within a 10-minute walk (800 meters) of a public park. I used census tract population data, spatial buffers, and area-weighted overlays to figure out what percent of each tract had access to parks.
    </p>

    <h2>Access Isn’t Equal</h2>
    <p>
      Polk and Johnson Counties had the highest average access—both around 67%. That means most people in those areas can walk to a park. But in places like Scott, Hamilton, and Page Counties, access was much lower—below 5% on average.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I averaged across all 10 counties, about 43% of people live within walking distance of a park. So overall, access is pretty mixed.
    </p>

    <h2>Some Counties Have Big Gaps</h2>
    <p>
      I also looked at standard deviation, which shows how much access varies between neighborhoods. Johnson, Linn, and Polk Counties had the biggest differences—some neighborhoods had full access, while others had almost none. In more rural counties like Floyd or Page, access was low across the board.
    </p>

    <h2>Where People Live Affects Access</h2>
    <p>
      Not surprisingly, counties with larger populations (like Polk and Linn) had smaller, denser tracts and better walkable access. Rural counties like Harrison and Hamilton had huge tracts and much lower access, just because everything is more spread out. One interesting exception was Scott County—it’s more urban, but still had very low access.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Tells Me</h2>
    <p>
      Urban counties had better park access overall, but there are big differences from neighborhood to neighborhood. That’s an equity issue worth paying attention to. In rural areas, it’s not realistic to build a ton of parks, but maybe trails or shared green space could make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step would be to bring in demographic data—like income, age, or disability status—to see who’s being left out the most. That would help target park investments where they’re needed most.
